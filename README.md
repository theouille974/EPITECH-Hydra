## 🧭 Introduction

Welcome to the documentation of the **Hydra CTF (Capture The Flag)** project — an immersive and intellectually stimulating cybersecurity challenge undertaken as part of the EPITECH curriculum.

This project explores a wide array of cybersecurity concepts, ranging from **Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)** to **advanced privilege escalation techniques**.  
This document provides a complete overview of the strategies applied and the critical **flags captured** across various challenges.

## 💡 Project Overview

The **Hydra project** is structured into a series of progressive **“rooms”**, each crafted to assess and refine specific cybersecurity skills.

- 🕵️ Starts with an **OSINT investigation**, laying the foundation.
- 🔍 Advances into deeper challenges involving:
  - **Reconnaissance**
  - **Web enumeration**
  - **Hash cracking**
  - **Vulnerability exploitation**
  - **Privilege escalation**

Every room builds upon the previous one, mimicking real-world penetration testing scenarios.

## 🌐 What is OSINT?

**OSINT** (*Open Source Intelligence*) refers to the practice of collecting, analyzing, and leveraging **publicly accessible information** to gather actionable insights.

Used widely in cybersecurity, journalism, and law enforcement, OSINT techniques include:

- Scouring social media platforms
- Mining public databases
- Analyzing metadata and digital footprints

In the Hydra project, the OSINT challenge serves as a hands-on introduction to this vital skill — requiring participants to uncover key information using only public sources.

## 🛠️ Challenge Structure

Each room in the Hydra CTF delivers a unique cybersecurity scenario. You'll be confronted with a diverse mix of **tools, methods, and exploit types**, including but not limited to:

- 📡 Network scanning
- 🌐 Web enumeration
- 🧠 Hash identification and cracking
- 🐞 Exploiting vulnerabilities (e.g., **XXE**, **SUID misconfigurations**)
- 🧬 Privilege escalation paths

---

This documentation walks you through **each challenge**, detailing:

- 🔎 The investigative process
- 🧪 Techniques and tools used
- 🚩 Flags captured
- 📚 Key takeaways

It’s more than a walkthrough — it’s a blueprint for understanding and applying cybersecurity concepts in real-world contexts.
